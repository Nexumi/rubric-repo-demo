# Rubric Repo Demo
`rubrics.txt` is the command and control file
- Contains the list of available rubrics to download
- All rubrics should exist within the same directory of `rubrics.txt`
  - The rubric names listed in `rubrics.txt` must match the ones found in the directory
- Give the users the URL to the path that contains the rubrics and `rubrics.txt`
  - For this repo, that would be `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nexumi/rubric-repo-demo/main/`
  - Found by clicking `rubrics.txt` > Raw > Copy URL but omit the `rubrics.txt`
  - In theory this could be set up in the same format on the file manager

Note: These are Fall 2024 Rubrics
